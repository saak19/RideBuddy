**RouteBuddy – MVP (Minimum Viable Product)**

### The Problem

Transportation in cities and towns is often inefficient:

* Riders struggle to find affordable, safe, and quick rides.
* Drivers waste fuel and time traveling with empty seats.
* Existing ride-sharing apps are expensive or limited to big cities.

### The Solution

RouteBuddy connects **drivers with empty seats** and **riders needing affordable transport**.
Think of it as a simple community-based ride-sharing platform.

### Who It’s For

* **Riders** (students, workers, travelers) who want cheaper and more accessible travel.
* **Drivers** (car owners, commuters) who want to save fuel costs and earn extra money.

### MVP Features

To keep the first version lean but functional:

1. **User Authentication** – Sign up/login as a *Driver* or *Rider* using Firebase Auth.
2. **Basic Profiles** – Drivers can add car info; Riders just need name/contact.
3. **Post a Ride (Driver)** – Driver enters start point, destination, time, and available seats.
4. **Find a Ride (Rider)** – Rider searches available trips and requests a seat.
5. **Simple Ride Confirmation** – Once a driver accepts, both parties see trip details.
6. **Landing Page** – Public-facing home page explaining what RouteBuddy is, with a “Get Started” button that takes users to login.

### What Comes Later (Future Versions)

* Real-time ride tracking with maps.
* In-app payments and wallet system.
* Ratings and reviews for trust.
* Group messaging or in-app chat.
* AI route optimization to match drivers and riders better.

### Why This MVP Works

* It proves the **core value**: connecting drivers and riders.
* It’s simple enough to build fast and test with real users.
* It creates a foundation to add advanced features as the community grows.
