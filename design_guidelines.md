### D. Component Library

### E. Images

**Hero Image:** Full-width background image showing a modern ride-sharing scenario - friendly driver and passenger in a clean vehicle, urban setting visible through windows, natural lighting. Image should convey trust, safety, and community.

**Feature Section Icons:** Use Heroicons library, no custom images needed

**How It Works:** Consider simple illustrations or icons for each step (can use <!-- PLACEHOLDER: illustration description --> comments)

**Optional Section Images:** 
- Phone mockup showing the app interface

- Happy riders/drivers in authentic scenarios

### F. Interactions & Motion

**Minimize animations** - use sparingly:
